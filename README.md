# AutonomousDrone
Currently in phase one of the project

## What has been done?
- Assembly of drone framwork
- Addition of components, batteries
- Collection of fire dataset
- Annotation using Roboflow
- Preparation of dataset, training, evalutation using Tensorboard and testing

## What are we supposed to begin with?
- Test flight of the drone for stability, part issues
- Testing the model impact and effectiveness in real world situation
- Integration of SCB (Nvidia Jetson) with the flight controller
- Defining a basic rule-based action for the flight behaviour
- Testing with the model deployed
