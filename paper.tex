\begin{abstract}
In the recent years, there has been a steady growth of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies, especially in sectors like defense, logistics, film-making and exploration.
We propose an autonomous drone that can take part in rescue missions, where timely action can save lives. The scope of the project is limited to fire detection and extinguishment. We have used a custom-data trained flame detection deep learning model that can be used in a low-powered IoT (internet of things) single-board computer attached to the drone's flight controller.

\section{Introduction}
Fire is one of the many hazards that is recognised as one of the many leading causes of death, and can damage economy as well as the environment\cite{b1, b2, b3, b4}. There is a need to respond quickly in order to contain the fire, or else the situation may go out of hand. Factors like poor road conditions, traffic, and distance may disrupt the rescue operation that uses traditional methods. There are other factors like location of the source of fire hazard, as well as the lack of information of that area.

Firefighting tools have evolved over time \cite{b5}, but not to the level that is on par with other sectors. These tools still require the need for human intervention, which might be a problem, as such tools may require a skilled operator, who cannot replace a fire fighter, and remote options might not be the best option in areas with communication interference, and poor tower signal. Artificial Intelligence may be introducted to one such tool - an unmanned aerial vehicle that can carry and shoot water. The drones will be equipped with fire detection capabilities and will be able to extinguish the fires via a attached extinguisher module.  The integration of firefighting drones with deep learning will allow for ease of access and control of fire outbreaks. Drones will also result in increased response time, prevention of further damage, and allow relaying of vital information to out of reach places regarding the characteristics of the fire scene.

\section{Literature Review}
%Although there were several controversy around the YOLOv5 model underperforming the YOLOv4 model, the sheer amount of well-written blogs and documentation was what made us go with YOLOv5.
